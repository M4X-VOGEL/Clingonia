Toggle All Paths
----------------
The button, along with its associated list below, allows you to see the individual numbered train paths along with its start coordinates and orientation. The number in the cell represents the timestep on which the train occupies the cell.

Clicking the "Toggle All Paths" Button will either show all numbered paths or hide them.
