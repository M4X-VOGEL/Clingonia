|   Random Generation   |
|-----------------------|



-----------------
"Generate" Button
-----------------
Generates a complete Flatland environment and corresponding image based on the specified parameters.



----------
Parameters
----------

=== Environment rows:
The height of the rail map. (X-direction in Flatland)
=== 


=== Environment columns:
The width of the rail map. (Y-direction in Flatland)
=== 


=== Number of agents:
Number of agents to spawn on the map.
=== 


=== Max. number of cities:
Maximum number of cities that the generator will attempt to create based on the specified parameters.
=== 


=== Seed:
A starting number that directly influences the Flatland environment. Using the same seed will always generate an identical layout of tracks, trains, and cities.
===

Displays additional parameters for advanced users.



---------------------
Parameters (Advanced)
---------------------

=== Use grid mode:
True: cities are distributed uniformly in a grid.
False: cities are placed randomly.
=== 


=== Max. number of rails between cities:
Maximum number of rails connecting to a city.
This value specifies the number of connection points along the city's border; the actual number of tracks between cities may vary.
=== 


=== Max. number of rail pairs in cities:
Determines the number of parallel tracks available within a city, reflecting the capacity of its train stations.
=== 


=== Remove agents on arrival:
True: Agents are removed upon reaching their destination.
False: Agents remain, blocking the destination.
=== 


=== Speed ratio map for trains:
Defines the distribution of train speeds.
Format: {speed : chance of occurring}.
For example, {1.0: 0.5, 0.25: 0.5} indicates a 50% chance for a train to have a speed of 1 (one cell per timestep) and a 50% chance to have a speed of 0.25 (one cell every 4 timesteps).
Note: Speeds must be in the form 1/n, and the probabilities must sum to 1
=== 


=== Malfunction rate:
A fraction A/B representing the probability per timestep that an agent malfunctions. For example, 1/3 indicates that, on average, a malfunction occurs every third timestep.
=== 


=== Min. duration for malfunctions:
The shortest duration (in timesteps) that a malfunction can last.
=== 


=== Max. duration for malfunctions:
The longest duration (in timesteps) that a malfunction can last.
=== 


=== Low quality mode:
Lowers resolution to significantly reduce the PNG file size.
