=== Speed ratio map for trains:
Defines the distribution of train speeds.
Format: {speed : chance of occurring}.
For example, {1.0: 0.5, 0.25: 0.5} indicates a 50% chance for a train to have a speed of 1 (one cell per timestep) and a 50% chance to have a speed of 0.25 (one cell every 4 timesteps).
Note: Speeds must be in the form 1/n, and the probabilities must sum to 1
=== 


=== Malfunction rate:
A fraction A/B representing the probability per timestep that an agent malfunctions. For example, 1/3 indicates that, on average, a malfunction occurs every third timestep.
=== 


=== Min. duration for malfunctions:
The shortest duration (in timesteps) that a malfunction can last.
=== 


=== Max. duration for malfunctions:
The longest duration (in timesteps) that a malfunction can last.
