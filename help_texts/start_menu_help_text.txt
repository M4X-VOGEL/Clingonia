                |   Welcome to Clingonia!   |
                |---------------------------|



Introduction
------------
Experience next-generation Flatland environment management:

Effortlessly generate, build, modify, save, and solve environments using Clingo powered by the Answer Set Programming Language.

Additionally, visualize your solutions as a numbered path, detailed timetable, or animated GIF for clear, actionable insights.



(!) Terminal
------------
Important: Clingonia provides real-time status updates in the terminal. During extended load times, we recommend checking there to monitor your progress.



Get Started
-----------
Begin by generating a Flatland environment based on your parameters, building a custom setup via our build menu, or importing an existing LP file with the environment ASP code into Clingonia.



Generate Random Environment
---------------------------
Set parameters to create a complete, seed-based Flatland environment.

Define dimensions, the number of trains and cities, rail system details, and train behaviors.



Build New Environment
---------------------
First, define your grid size and specify train behavior. Then, enter the Railway Creation Lab: Simply select and place rails onto the grid.

Once your rail network is complete, you can add trains with their corresponding stations and details like Earliest Departure and Latest Arrival.

Finally, feast your eyes on a rendered image of your masterpiece!



Load Environment
----------------
Select an LP file from your computer that contains the ASP code for an environment.

The program then scans the file for explicit predicates:

- train(ID).
- start(ID, (row, column), earliest_departure, direction).
- end(ID, (row, column), latest_arrival).
- cell((row, column), track).

Each predicate must adhere to these conditions:

ID: integer >= 0
row and column: integers >= 0
earliest_departure and latest_arrival: integers > 0
direction: one of n, e, s, or w
track: a Flatland-defined integer representing a specific rail



Don't Derail Now!
----------------
However, when you've enjoyed the ride,
it's time to pull the brakes.
At any time, you may exit the program
by pressing the ESC key.



About MadMotion
---------------
MadMotion was founded in 2024 at the University of Potsdam as part of the "Railway Scheduling in Flatland" project.

Our team, comprised of two dedicated computer science students - Adrian Henze and Max Vogel - who began their studies in 2019, has united to develop Clingonia: A user-friendly GUI program that integrates the innovative realms of Flatland and Answer Set Programming (ASP).
