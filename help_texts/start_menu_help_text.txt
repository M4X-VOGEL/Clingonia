Generate Random Environment
---------------------------
Here you can get a random environment.
This will include a track network and a list of trains.

You can adjust the settings of generation like how big you want the environment or how many trains you want on it.


Build New Environment
---------------------
Here you can build your own environment.
you can place the tracks and trains however you want.


Load Custom Environment
-----------------------
Here you can load a previously saved environment.
Just click the button and select any .lp file that contains a flatland environment.

NOTE:

If the file was not saved by this program, ensure your file only contains:

    - train(ID).
    - start(ID,(column,row),earliest departure, direction).
    - end(ID,(column,row),latest arrival).
    - cell((column,row),trackID).

Where:

    - ID is an integer > 0.
    - column and row are integers > 0.
    - earliest departure is an integer > or = 0.
    - latest arrival is an integer > 0.
    - trackID is one of the id's defined by flatland.
    - you need exactly one start and end for each train
    - cells must fill a grid with size (columns,rows)
