Generate Random Environment
---------------------------
Here you can get a random environment.
This will include a track network and a list of trains.

You can adjust the settings of generation like how big you want the environment or how many trains you want on it.


Build New Environment
---------------------
Here you can build your own environment.
you can place the tracks and trains however you want.


Modify Custom Environment
---------------------
Here you can modify any environment.
You can change the grid size or any other parameter.
You can remove the tracks and trains.
You can place new tracks and trains.
Or you can change the settings of any train you placed.


Save Custom Environment
-----------------------
Save the current environment to a .lp file.
Just navigate to the folder where you want to save your environment and select any file you want to save to or enter the name of a new file.


Load Custom Environment
-----------------------
Here you can load a previously saved environment.
Just click the button and select any .lp file that contains a flatland environment.

NOTE:

If the file was not saved by this program, ensure your file only contains:

    - train(ID).
    - start(ID,(column,row),earliest departure, direction).
    - end(ID,(column,row),latest arrival).
    - cell((column,row),trackID).

Where:

    - ID is an integer > 0.
    - column and row are integers > 0.
    - earliest departure is an integer > or = 0.
    - latest arrival is an integer > 0.
    - trackID is one of the id's defined by flatland.
    - you need exactly one start and end for each train
    - cells must fill a grid with size (columns,rows)


Next: Clingo Solver
-------------------
This will take you to the settings for the clingo solver.
Here you can also simulate your environment.
