Generate Random Environment
---------------------------
Set parameters to create a complete, seed-based Flatland environment.

Define dimensions, the number of trains and cities, rail system details, and train behaviors.

After generation, you will receive a detailed overview.



Build New Environment
---------------------
First, define your grid size and specify train behavior. Then, enter the Railway Creation Lab: Simply select and place rails onto the grid.

Once your rail network is complete, you can add trains with their corresponding stations and details like Earliest Departure and Latest Arrival.

Finally, feast your eyes on a detailed overview of your masterpiece!



Modify Environment
------------------
Modify Mode works like Build Mode, allowing you to adjust the same parameters.

Instead of starting with a blank grid, you begin with the environment that you have loaded, generated, or built.

You will be able to reposition rails, trains, and stations using the same controls, and even modify the grid size.

Once you are satisfied with your adjustments, you will receive a detailed overview.



Save Environment
----------------
Choose where to store the LP file associated with the currently shown environment and specify a filename.

Additionally, the Image-toggle lets you save the generated image with the LP file.



Load Environment
----------------
Select an LP file from your computer that contains the ASP code for an environment.

The program then scans the file for explicit predicates:

- train(ID).
- start(ID, (row, column), earliest_departure, direction).
- end(ID, (row, column), latest_arrival).
- cell((row, column), track).

Each predicate must adhere to these conditions:

ID: integer >= 0
row and column: integers >= 0
earliest_departure and latest_arrival: integers > 0
direction: one of n, e, s, or w
track: a Flatland-defined integer representing a specific rail



Next: Clingo Solver
-------------------
Get to the final step: Enter your Clingo parameters and select the LP files for solving the environment.

Once configured, you can run the simulation to produce the solutions.



Don't Derail Now!
----------------
However, when you've enjoyed the ride,
it's time to pull the brakes.
At any time, you may exit the program
by pressing the ESC key.
