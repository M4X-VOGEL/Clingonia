===

The width of the rail map.
(Y-axis in Flatland)
=== 


=== Number of agents:
Number of agents to
spawn on the map.

Parameters (Advanced)
---------------------

=== Use grid mode:
True:  Distributes cities
       uniformly in a grid.
False: Distr. cities randomly.
=== 


=== Max. number of rails
    between cities:
Maximum number of rails
connecting to a city.
 This value specifies the
number of connection points
along the city's border.
 The actual number of tracks
between cities may vary.
=== 


=== Max. number of rail pairs
    in cities:
Maximum number of parallel
tracks available within a city,
reflecting the capacity
of its train stations.
=== 


=== Remove agents on arrival:
True:  Agents are removed upon
       reaching their destination.
False: Agents remain, blocking
       the destination.
=== 


=== Low quality mode:
Lowers resolution to significantly
reduce the PNG file size.
 Low quality is the default for
environments over 1000x1000.
===



-----------------------------
Parameters (no Clingo impact)
-----------------------------

=== Speed ratio map for trains:
Distribution of train speeds.
 Format:  {speed : probability}
 Example: {1.0: 0.5, 0.25: 0.5}
> 50 % chance for speed 1
  (one cell every timestep)
> 50 % chance for speed 0.25
  (one cell every 4 timesteps)
Note: Speeds must be of the form
      1/n, and the probabilities
      must sum to 1.
=== 


=== Malfunction rate:
Fraction A/B represents the
per-timestep malfunction
probability.
 Example: 1/3 means a malfunction
occurs on average every
three timesteps.
=== 


=== Min. duration for malfunctions:
Shortest number of timesteps
a malfunction can last.
=== 


=== Max. duration for malfunctions:
Longest number of timesteps
a malfunction can last.
===
