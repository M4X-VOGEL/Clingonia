(!) Terminal
------------

Important: Clingonia provides real-time status updates in the terminal. During extended load times, we recommend checking there to monitor your progress.



---------------------------
Generate Random Environment
---------------------------

Set parameters to create a complete, seed-based Flatland environment.

Define dimensions, the number of trains and cities, rail system details, and train behaviors.



---------------------
Build New Environment
---------------------

Kick off your custom build by defining your grid size and specifying train behavior. Then, unleash your creativity in the Railway Creation Lab: Simply select and place rails onto the grid.

Once your rail network is complete, add trains with their corresponding stations and details.

Finally, feast your eyes on a rendered image of your masterpiece!



------------------
Modify Environment
------------------

Modify Mode works like Build Mode, allowing you to adjust the same parameters.

Instead of starting with a blank grid, you begin with the environment that you have loaded, generated, or built.

You can reposition rails, trains, and stations and even adjust the grid size using the same controls.



----------------
Save Environment
----------------

Choose where to save the LP file for the current environment and specify a filename.

Additionally, the "Image" toggle allows you to save the generated image with the LP file.



----------------
Load Environment
----------------

Select an LP file from your computer that contains the ASP code for an environment.

The program then scans the file for explicit predicates:

- train(ID).
- start(ID, (row, column), earliest_departure, direction).
- end(ID, (row, column), latest_arrival).
- cell((row, column), track).

Each predicate must adhere to these conditions:

ID: integer >= 0
row and column: integers >= 0
earliest_departure and latest_arrival: integers > 0
direction: one of n, e, s, or w
track: a Flatland-defined integer representing a specific rail



-------------------
Next: Clingo Solver
-------------------

Proceed to the final step: Enter your Clingo parameters and select the LP files for solving the environment. Once configured, you can run the simulation to visualize the solution.

Don't Derail Now!

However, when you've enjoyed the ride,
it's time to pull the brakes.
At any time, you may exit the program
by pressing the ESC key.
