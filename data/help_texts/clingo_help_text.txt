|   Clingo Solver   |
|-------------------|



Configure the Clingo executable path,
select which answer set to visualize,
and choose your additional ASP problem-solving files.
Once all parameters are set, you can run the simulation.

For Malfunctions, see "Select Problem-Solving LP Files".



-----------
Clingo Path
-----------

Enter the full path to your clingo.exe or simply use "clingo" if it is included in your system's PATH.

Alternatively, use the Python clingo API by entering "API".



-----------------------------
Clingo Options (NOT REQUIRED)
-----------------------------

Enter additional options for the clingo.exe command line.
Example: --stats
Separate multiple options using spaces.
Example: --option1 --option2

(!) Be aware that some options may cause the program
    to malfunction. Use at your own risk.



-----------------
Answer to display
-----------------

Choose which answer set from Clingo should be visualized
(default is 1).

If you rerun the simulation without changing parameters, Clingonia reuses the previous result. If you changed the file encoding, select Answer 0 to force a new run for Answer 1.



-------------------------------
Select Problem-Solving LP Files
-------------------------------

Browse and select your ASP encoding files via the file explorer. These files should only contain the ASP code for solving the environment.

(!) Please do NOT include the environment encoding and/or malfunction_tmp.lp here.

Malfunctions can be customized by editing the generated malfunction_tmp.lp file in Clingonia's data folder; it is generated only when the malfunction rate is non-zero.

If Clingonia does not offer a particular feature, it must be integrated into your problem-solving LP files.



--------------
Run Simulation
--------------

Once the parameters are set, click this button to execute Clingo and visualize the solution based on the answer set.

Ensure the following action format:
- action(train(ID), Action, Timestep),
where ID and Timestep are integers, and
Action must be one of the following:
move_forward, move_left, move_right or wait.

(!) Please note that the simulation may range from a few seconds to several minutes, depending on the complexity of the problem. During extended load times, we recommend checking the terminal to monitor your progress.



---------------------------------
Extra: Options for Clingo Command
---------------------------------

This feature was not originally planned,
but you can enable additional options
like --stats for further analysis.

Simply add them to the "clingo_options" list
at the beginning of code/clingo_actions.py.

Note that Clingonia must restart
to apply the changes, so consider
saving your environment.



-----------------
Don't Derail Now!
-----------------

However, when you've enjoyed the ride,
it's time to pull the brakes.
At any time, you may exit the program
by pressing the ESC key.
